# Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series

In this Notebook we propose a detailed study and an implementation of the article of Magnus Wiese, Robert Knobloch, Ralf Korn and Peter Kretschmer : _Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series_. The idea is to propose a new algorithm to Modeling financial time series with Quant GANs. That consists of a generator and discriminator functions which utilize temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and thereby achieve to capture long-range dependencies such as the presence of volatility clusters.

Project done as part of the Deep Learning: Models and Optimization course, taught during the third year of the engineering cycle at ENSAE Paris, supervised by M. Cuturi.
